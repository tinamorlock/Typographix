# Project Overview
This is a code-along project from the Zero to Mastery CSS course. It is a minimalist landing page for a company. This is not the final version of this project; it is merely a starting point as I work on sharpening my CSS skills. 

This code is not my original design, but it is something I have learned quite a bit of design and CSS skills as I've worked on it.

I used the following technologies for this project:

* Visual Studio Code
* WebStorm
* CSS
* HTML
* Git
## Version
v1
## Features
* Google fonts
* Font Awesome
* CSS Animation for icons and text
## Upcoming Plans
I used this as a base design for my development portfolio project found here: https://tinamorlock.github.io/Dev-Portfolio/
## Current Design
